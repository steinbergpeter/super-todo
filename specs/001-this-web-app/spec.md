# Feature Specification: Web App for Discussions, Comments, and Likes

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-web-app`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This web app allows users to sign up with authentication, to create Discussions, to Subscribe to other user's Discussions, Comment on Discussions, Comment on other Comments, and Like Comments. User who creates a Discussion is the Admin for that Discussion. Admin can delete any comment in their Discussions, and have the choice to delete just that comment replacing it with an indicator that it has been deleted, but leave the children, or to delete the Comment *and* all of its children. Users who are not Admin can subscribe to Discussion, and once subscribed, can Comment, including Commenting on other Comments. Users other than the Admin can edit or delete their own Comments, but not anyone else's. Users can Like or Unlike other user's Comments. Users can sign out. When Users sign in, they will have a list of all the discussions they are Subscribed to. User actions will be optimistic. Data will be stored on a database."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
3. For each unclear aspect: Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing
Users can subscribe to Discussions, tracked via a Subscription entity in the database. Subscriptions allow users to receive in-app notifications and access a personalized dashboard of their discussions. The Subscription model supports extensibility and aligns with project governance for maintainability and testability.
## Clarifications
### Technical Decisions (2025-09-25)
  
Users can subscribe to Discussions, tracked via a Subscription entity in the database. Subscriptions allow users to receive in-app notifications and access a personalized dashboard of their discussions. The Subscription model supports extensibility and aligns with project governance for maintainability and testability.
- Folder structure revised for mono repo: apps/client, apps/server, packages/db, packages/services, packages/ui, tests/*
- Prisma ORM selected for database management; schema and client generated in shared package
- Subscription added as a first-class entity in the schema

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What authentication method should be used for user sign-up and login? ‚Üí A: Both email/password and OAuth
- Q: How long should deleted comments (indicator) be retained before permanent removal? ‚Üí A: Indefinitely (never auto-remove)
- Q: What is the maximum allowed nesting depth for comments? ‚Üí A: 5 levels
- Q: How should notifications for new comments, likes, or subscriptions be delivered to users? ‚Üí A: In-app only (dashboard/alerts)

### Primary User Story

A user signs up, authenticates, and can create a Discussion. Other users can subscribe to Discussions, comment on Discussions or other Comments, and like Comments. The Discussion creator (Admin) can moderate comments, including deleting comments (with options for cascading or non-cascading delete). Users can edit or delete their own comments, and like/unlike others' comments. When signing in, users see a list of their subscribed Discussions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign up and authenticate, **Then** they can create a Discussion.
2. **Given** a Discussion, **When** another user subscribes, **Then** they can comment and like comments.
3. **Given** a Comment, **When** the Admin deletes it, **Then** it is either replaced with a deletion indicator or removed with all its children, as chosen.
4. **Given** a Comment, **When** a non-Admin user deletes their own comment, **Then** only that comment is deleted.
5. **Given** a Comment, **When** a user likes or unlikes it, **Then** the like status is updated.
6. **Given** a user signs in, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see all Discussions they are subscribed to (tracked via Subscription entity).

### Edge Cases

1. **Commenting without Subscription**: If a user attempts to comment on a Discussion they are not subscribed to, the system MUST prevent the action and display a clear error message.
2. **Deeply Nested Comment Deletion**: When deleting a comment with many nested children, the system MUST either cascade delete all children (if chosen) or replace only the selected comment with a deletion indicator, leaving children intact. The system MUST handle this efficiently and avoid orphaned references.
3. **Admin Deletes Own Comment**: If the Admin deletes their own comment, the system MUST apply the same deletion options (indicator or cascade) and ensure Admin privileges are not lost for the Discussion.
4. **Optimistic Update Failure**: If a database write fails after an optimistic UI update, the system MUST revert the UI change and inform the user of the failure, providing guidance for retry or support.
5. **User Likes Own Comment**: If a user attempts to like their own comment, the system MUST block the action and display a clear message explaining the restriction.
6. **Maximum Nesting Depth**: If a user attempts to create a comment beyond 5 levels of nesting, the system MUST prevent the action and inform the user of the limit.
7. **Notification Delivery Failure**: If in-app notifications for new comments, likes, or subscriptions fail to deliver, the system MUST log the failure and provide fallback mechanisms (e.g., retry, dashboard alert).

## Requirements

*Ambiguities marked for clarification:*

- **FR-016**: System MUST authenticate users via both email/password and OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.).

- **FR-018**: System MUST enforce a maximum nesting depth of 5 levels for comments.
- **FR-019**: System MUST deliver notifications for new comments, likes, or subscriptions via in-app dashboard/alerts only.

### Non-Functional Requirements
